A Vim colorscheme with red-blue colors.
Based on [vim-bruin](https://git.sr.ht/~romainl/vim-bruin) by Romain Lafourcade.
Optimised for C, C++, Doxygen, Org-mode.

The intention was to use a different color for each "facet" of the code: one
for keywords and special symbols, one for macros, one for strings, and one for
comments. It makes it easy to read complex C++ programmes.
